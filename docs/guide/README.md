Once you are connected to your database Beekeeper Studio allows you to open tabs to do the following things:

1. Write and execute SQL Queries (this is what tabs do by default)
2. View table contents

### Using the SQL Editor

Writing SQL is such a fundamental part of interacting with a relational database that we put this functionality front and center.

You can use the SQL query tab to write, and run, SQL queries quickly and easily.

#### Run Contexts

If you like writing big long SQL scripts with multiple queries in the same editor pane (I know I do), you might want to only run a portion of your script at a time.

Beekeeper allows you to:

1. Run everything (this is the default)
2. Run only the 'current' query (Beekeeper highlights this query for you so you know what will run)
3. Run only what you have selected.
