## Contributing Guidelines

Last updated: Feb 15 2022

We welcome community contributions! If you're thinking of contributing, thank you!

We ask that all contributors abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/code_of_conduct.md)


### Opening Issues

We have templates for questions, features, or bug reports, please follow the directions in these templates, but generally:

- Please give as much detail as possible about the feature or issue.
- Include OS, database type, database version, and app version
- Include steps to replicate (eg the SQL to run)

### Pull Requests

We welcome code contributions. You maintain all copyright to your code, but agree that:

- All contributions to this repository are made under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

What this means practically:

If you make a PR, the PR code is licensed as MIT. As soon as I merge the code into this repository it is relicensed under GPLv3 as part of Beekeeper Studio. the code is still copyright to you.

Why do it this way?

This makes it easier to ensure that Beekeeper Studio code, and third party derivatives, stay open source, but also allows me to use contributed code as part of the ultimate edition.
