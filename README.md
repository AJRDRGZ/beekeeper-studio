# Beekeeper Studio

Beekeeper Studio is a free and open source SQL editor and database manager. Beekeeper Studio is cross-platform, and available for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

## Features

- Autocomplete SQL query editor with syntax highlighting
- Tabbed interface, so you can multitask
- Sort and filter table data to find just what you need
- Sensible keyboard-shortcuts
- Save queries for later
- Query run-history, so you can find that one query you got working 3 days ago
- Default dark theme

One of our frustrations with other open-source SQL editors and database managers is that they take a 'kitchen sink' approach to features, adding so many features that the UI becomes cluttered and hard to navigate. We wanted a good looking, open source SQL workbench that powerful, but also easy to use. We couldn't find one, so we created it!

## Big Thanks

Beekeeper Studio wouldn't exist without [Sqlectron-core](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core), the core database libraries from the (now unmaintained) Sqlectron project. Beekeeper Studio started as an experimental fork of that repository. A big thanks to @maxcnunes and the rest of the Sqlectron community.
